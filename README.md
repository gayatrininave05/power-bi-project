# README - Data Analytics on Engineering Colleges

## Project Overview

This project focuses on **data gathering, cleaning, and visualization** of engineering colleges in **Maharashtra** using **Power BI**. It provides insights into student enrollments, college performance, accreditation, and course trends from **2020 to 2024**.

## Data Gathering

The dataset was collected from the **AICTE official website** by following these steps:

1. **Visit AICTE Website** - Navigate to the official site.
2. **Go to Statistics Section** - Locate sections like "Statistics" or "Reports".
3. **Apply Filters** - Filter by year (2021-2022), level (UG), state (Maharashtra), and program (Engineering & Technology).
4. **Manual Data Collection** - If the data is not downloadable, manually copy it into Excel.

## Data Cleaning Techniques

1. **Handling Missing Values:**
   - Remove rows/columns with insignificant missing data.
   - Remove blank rows.
2. **Removing Duplicates:**
   - Use unique identifiers to detect duplicates.
   - Delete duplicate rows.
3. **Fixing Errors:**
   - Correct incorrect data manually.
   - Keep only undergraduate engineering courses.
4. **Standardization:**
   - Ensure uniform data formats (e.g., date, course names).
5. **Handling Outliers:**
   - Identify and remove extreme values to improve accuracy.

## Data Visualization Insights (Power BI Reports)

1. **Course Enrollment Trends:** Track student enrollments from 2020 to 2024.
2. **College Performance:** Compare colleges based on student intake and course offerings.
3. **Course Popularity:** Identify the most and least popular engineering courses.
4. **Institution Type Analysis:** Examine distribution across government, private, and other institution types.
5. **Geographical Insights:** Map the distribution of colleges across different districts.
6. **Program Analysis:** Study student distribution across engineering programs.
7. **Yearly Trends:** Analyze shifts in student enrollment and course offerings over time.
8. **Accreditation Insights:** Assess the impact of accreditation on student enrollments.
9. **Intake Analysis:** Identify yearly trends in student intake across colleges and courses.

## Steps for Power BI Dashboard Creation

### Visualizations Used:

1. **Bar Chart:** Course-wise student enrollment.
2. **Line Chart:** Yearly enrollment trends.
3. **Pie Chart:** Student distribution by program.
4. **Donut Chart:** Institution type distribution.
5. **Combo Chart:** Course vs. student trends.
6. **Scatter Chart:** Course count vs. student numbers.
7. **Tree Map:** Course popularity.
8. **Map Visualization:** Geographical college distribution.
9. **Matrix:** Course-wise enrollment by year.

## Conclusion

This project provides **data-driven insights** into engineering education in Maharashtra. By leveraging **Power BI**, we can help institutions, policymakers, and students make informed decisions based on enrollment patterns, accreditation, and geographical distributions.
